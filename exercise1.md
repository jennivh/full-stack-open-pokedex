# Exercise 1
For this exercise, I chose Python. I found out that Flake8 is one good linter for Python. It fixes stylistic and logical errors. It is a combination of three separate linters: PyFlakes, pycodestyle and McCabe. Another linter for Python is Pylama. It is a code audit tool that is made of many more than three linters.

There are many testing frameworks for Python. For example, Behave, Lettuce and Robot Framework are just some of testing frameworks I found when searching. Behave Framework is said to be very useful when one is doing behavior-driven development. Lettuce Framework is very similar to it. Robot Framework is recommended for acceptance testing. If one wants to do unit testing, I found that Pytest Framework and PyUnit Framework would be good options.

I found many automated build tools for Python. PyBuilder is an open-source one, Poetry is an “all-in-one” solution and SCons is another open-source tool.

Alternatives for Jenkins and Github Actions are for example CircleCI, which is a cloud-based CI tool. Unlike Jenkins, CircleCI runs an online server, so you do not have to set up one even locally. Gitlab CI seems like Gitlab Actions, because it too is connected to git.

Because in the example project, the team is relatively small and they need to use GitHub or GitLab anyway, I would recommend they use the CI/CD tools in those environments. So, I would recommend using a cloud-based option
